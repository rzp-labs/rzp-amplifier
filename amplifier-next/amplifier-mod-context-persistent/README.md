# Persistent Context Manager Module

A context manager that extends SimpleContextManager with persistent file loading capabilities for cross-session memory.

## Purpose

Enable AI assistants to maintain context across sessions by loading project-specific context files (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, PROJECT.md, etc.) at session start. This allows teams to maintain consistent AI behavior and knowledge without manually injecting context each time.

## Features

- **Inherits from SimpleContextManager**: All base functionality (message storage, token counting, compaction)
- **File Loading at Session Start**: Automatically loads configured context files
- **Graceful Error Handling**: Skips missing files with warnings
- **Clear Context Labeling**: Each loaded file is labeled in the system message
- **Home Directory Expansion**: Supports `~/` paths

## Installation

```bash
cd amplifier-next/amplifier-mod-context-persistent
pip install -e .
```

## Configuration

In your Amplifier config.toml:

```toml
[modules]
context = "context-persistent"

[context]
# List of context files to load at session start
memory_files = [
    "./CLAUDE.md",
    "./AGENTS.md",
    "./PROJECT.md",
    "~/projects/shared/TEAM_CONTEXT.md"
]

# Standard context manager settings
max_tokens = 200000
compact_threshold = 0.92
```

## How It Works

1. **Session Start**: When mounted, the module loads all configured files
2. **File Processing**: Each file is read and added as a system message
3. **Context Labeling**: Files are clearly labeled (e.g., `[Context from CLAUDE.md]`)
4. **Error Handling**: Missing or unreadable files are skipped with warnings
5. **Normal Operation**: After loading, behaves like SimpleContextManager

## File Format Support

Currently supports plain text files (Markdown, text, etc.). Files are read as UTF-8 and inserted as-is into system messages.

### Example Loaded Message

```python
{
    'role': 'system',
    'content': '[Context from CLAUDE.md]\n\n# CLAUDE.md\n\nThis file provides guidance...'
}
```

## API

The module exposes the same API as SimpleContextManager with one additional method:

### PersistentContextManager

```python
class PersistentContextManager(SimpleContextManager):
    def __init__(self, memory_files: list[str] = None, max_tokens: int = 200_000, compact_threshold: float = 0.92)
    async def initialize(self) -> None  # Loads memory files

    # Inherited from SimpleContextManager:
    async def add_message(self, message: dict[str, Any]) -> None
    async def get_messages(self) -> list[dict[str, Any]]
    async def should_compact(self) -> bool
    async def compact(self) -> None
    async def clear(self) -> None
```

## Philosophy

This module follows the ruthless simplicity principle:
- **Simple file loading**: Just read files and add as system messages
- **No complex watching**: Files are loaded once at session start
- **Fail gracefully**: Missing files don't crash the system
- **Clear boundaries**: Memory files are read-only

## Common Use Cases

### Team Context Files

Maintain consistent AI behavior across a development team:

```toml
memory_files = [
    "./TEAM_STYLE_GUIDE.md",
    "./PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE.md",
    "./API_CONVENTIONS.md"
]
```

### Project-Specific Knowledge

Load project-specific documentation:

```toml
memory_files = [
    "./docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md",
    "./docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md",
    "./docs/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md"
]
```

### Personal Preferences

Individual developer preferences:

```toml
memory_files = [
    "~/.config/amplifier/MY_PREFERENCES.md",
    "./CLAUDE.md"
]
```

## Logging

The module logs at various levels:
- **INFO**: Successful file loads, mount status
- **WARNING**: Missing files
- **ERROR**: File read failures
- **DEBUG**: Empty files, detailed operations

## Limitations

- **Read-only**: Files are loaded at start, not monitored for changes
- **Text only**: Currently only supports text-based files
- **No auto-save**: Does not persist context back to files
- **Sequential loading**: Files are loaded in order specified

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

Potential future features that maintain simplicity:
- File watching for reload on changes
- TOML/JSON parsing for structured context
- Selective context persistence
- File change detection
