# Pure Delegation Architecture: Parent workspace tests
#
# The parent workspace uses pytest to run only parent-level tests.
# Submodule tests are run via recursive Makefile delegation (make test-all).
#
# This configuration prevents pytest from discovering submodule tests,
# which would cause ModuleNotFoundError since submodule packages are not
# installed in the parent's virtual environment.

# Only discover tests in parent's tests/ directory
testpaths = tests

# Exclude submodule directories and common non-test directories
